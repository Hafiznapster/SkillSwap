                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>Student Skill Exchange is a platform designed to connect students who want to teach and learn from each other. We believe that every student has unique skills and knowledge to share, and our mission is to facilitate the exchange of these skills within the student community.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">How It Works</h3>
                <p>Our platform uses a time banking system, where students earn credit hours by teaching others and can spend these hours to learn from fellow students. This creates a sustainable ecosystem of knowledge sharing.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Create a profile</strong> - List the skills you can teach and the ones you want to learn</li>
                    <li><strong>Get matched</strong> - Our system matches you with students based on complementary skills</li>
                    <li><strong>Schedule sessions</strong> - Arrange teaching or learning sessions at times that work for both of you</li>
                    <li><strong>Exchange skills</strong> - Meet up, teach, learn, and build a community of skilled students</li>
                    <li><strong>Rate and review</strong> - Provide feedback after sessions to help build trust in the community</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">Our Values</h3>
                <p>We are committed to:</p>
